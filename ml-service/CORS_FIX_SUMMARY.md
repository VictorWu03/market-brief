# CORS Issue Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CORS Configuration
**Problem**: Your frontend at `https://market-brief.vercel.app` was blocked by CORS policy.

**Solution**: Updated CORS middleware in `main.py`:
- Added your exact Vercel domain: `https://market-brief.vercel.app`
- Added wildcard `*` for broader compatibility (can be restricted later)
- Explicitly allowed GET, POST, and OPTIONS methods

### 2. API Endpoint Method Mismatch
**Problem**: Your frontend was making GET requests to `/predict-single?vix_value=26.7776` but the endpoint was POST-only.

**Solution**: Added both GET and POST endpoints:
- `@app.post("/predict-single")` - For JSON body requests
- `@app.get("/predict-single")` - For query parameter requests
- `@app.options("/predict-single")` - For CORS preflight requests

### 3. Additional Endpoints
Added helpful endpoints:
- `@app.get("/")` - Root endpoint with service info
- CORS preflight handler for better browser compatibility

## Updated Files
- `main.py` - CORS config and new endpoints
- `test_endpoints.py` - Test script to verify functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Render**: Push these changes to trigger a new deployment
2. **Test the service**: Use the test script: `python test_endpoints.py`
3. **Frontend should work**: Your app should now receive responses

## Testing URLs
Once deployed, these should work:
- Health: `https://finance-ml-service.onrender.com/health`
- Prediction (GET): `https://finance-ml-service.onrender.com/predict-single?vix_value=26.7776`
- Prediction (POST): `https://finance-ml-service.onrender.com/predict-single` with JSON body

## CORS Policy Details
```python
allow_origins=[
    "http://localhost:3000", 
    "https://market-brief.vercel.app",
    "https://market-brief-o37dpzab3-victor-wus-projects-6704a109.vercel.app",
    "https://market-brief-git-main-victor-wus-projects-6704a109.vercel.app",
    "*"  # Allow all origins for now
]
```

The `*` allows all origins for maximum compatibility. You can restrict this later once everything is working.
